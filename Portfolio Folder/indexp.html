						<h2>About me</h2>
						<p>
							I am 59 years young!<br>
						I am currently residing at Southern Maine Womens ReEntry Center in Windham because of a bad choice I made. I am in the process of serving for that bad choice and choosing to change my life in a positive way!<br>
						<p>I am originally from a small town in northern Aroostook County Maine. I have lived there pretty much my whole life.  I have been married for 38 years and have 4 sons and 12 amazing grandchildren.<br> My family is my world and I absolutely love being a Grammy :)!!<br> You can click on the link below to see more information about the county that I live in!</p>
						I guess to explain a little about me is pretty much, I lost myself somewhere along the way of getting married and having kids.  I love them dearly but I always put myself on the back burner and all my attention went towards taking care of them and everyone else.  When looking at this question of "About Me" I struggled to write about me because I discovered I didn't know me? Since being incarcerated I am starting to learn more about me and my interests and goals. I have always put others needs ahead of mine and I am learning that I need to start thinking about me and my needs!<br> 
						While here I have been involved in many programs like Book Club, Crocheting Class, Living Classroom, Volunteering where ever and whenever I can. I have also met some genuine good ladies that I play cards with and conversate with, some have become very special to me and I hope to stay in touch with them on the outside! I didn't plan on making friends while incarcerated but I feel lucky that I have met and befriended these additional special people in my life!
						<br>My favorite program is my Yoga Class every Friday with instructor Jess. I look forward to yoga every week. Yoga helps ground me and is helping me heal mind, body and soul! I also enjoy walking outsite alot. I love the smell of the fresh air, flowers and just being outside. Walking clears my mind and allows me to reflect on the choices I have made in my life and eventually get me back and helps me think clearer.<br>
						I also started working for CTI Cleaning Services Monday thru Friday. Working makes me feel useful and helping give back. Plus helps the days go by a little faster and gets me away from all the drama that goes on in here :).<br></p>

								<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
									<li>I baked and decorated custom cakes for about 20+ years for my small business. Weddings, birthdays, retirements etc basically cakes for any occassion. Some customers challenged me with some unusual designs but I loved the challenge and always delivered an amazing cake! I also added edible paper generated on a printer that had edible ink. With this option I was able to create custom designs on the computer and print on edible paper then apply to a cake! I only decorate cakes now for my family and grandkids birthdays now but I may get back into doing cakes down the road?</li>

							<li>Reading</li>
								<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
									<li>I never had time to read basically because I was always taking care of everyone else and just never did.
