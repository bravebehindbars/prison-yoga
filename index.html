			<p><strong>MY STORY!<br></strong>	
				A little about my story as to why I enjoy Yoga!
				I have always enjoyed yoga but since being incarcerated I participate in yoga class every Fridays with instructor Jess. She is wonderful and has such a calming voice, she is caring, compassionate and has never been judgemental. She takes the time to talk to each one of us about what is going on in our lives. She provides inspirational cards with quotes of encouragement and feelings to which I will include some on this page. Come the end of the week it is a way for me to wind down and reset my mind.<br>

				Most days while incarcerated there is so much that goes on in your brain and life gets crazy or so much drama that occurs that it is hard to focus but with yoga it is a great stress reducer, improved mental health, physical health benefits and also a great way to connect while in a group setting and help overcome feelings of isolation and build positive relationships. It also helps grounds me and helps me refocus on healing my mind, body and soul.

		<h1>Some ways yoga contributes to prison reform:</h1>
		<p>Addressing the Root Causes of Incarceration:<br>
				<p>Trauma recovery: Many individuals in prison have experienced significant trauma in their lives, which can contribute to negative behaviors and incarceration.  Trauma-informed yoga provides a safe space for participants to address and heal from trauma.
				<p>Empowerment and self regulation: Yoga helps individuals develop self-control, emotional stability, and the ability to regulate their impulses. This is crucial for managing difficult situations and making positive choices, both inside and outside of prison.
				<p>Healing over punishment: Prison reform initiatives often emphasize a shift from punitive justice to a more healing-centered approach.  Yoga aligns with this vision by focusing on addressing the underlying issues that constribute to criminal behavior.</p>
				</section>	

	<section class="p5">
				<h1>Enhancing Mental and Emotional Well-being:<br></h1>
				<p>Reduced stress and anxiety: Yoga is scientifically proven to reduce stress and anxiety, which are prevalent among incarcerated individuals.</p>
				<p>Improved mood and psychological well-being:<br> Studies have demonstrated that yoga can significantly improve mood, decrease psychological distress, and enhance overall mental health in prison populations.</p>
				<p>Increased self-awareness and self-compassion:<br> Through yoga and mindfulness practices, participants gain a deeper understanding of themselves, develop self-compassion, and learn to navigate challenging emotions with greater ease.</p>
				</section>



	<section class="p6">
				<h1>Promoting Positive Behavior and Reducing Recidivism:<br></h1>
				<p>Improved impulse control and decision-making:<br> Yoga helps individuals develop better impulse control and enhances their ability to make thoughtful and responsible decisions.

				<p>Reduced aggression and antisocial behavior:<br> Research suggests that yoga can lead to a decrease in aggression and antisocial behavior among incarcerated individuals.<br></p>

				<p>Increased pro-social skills:<br> Yoga fosters a sense of community, empathy, and compassion, which are essential for building positive relationships and contributing to society.<br></p>

				<p>Potential for reducing recidivism:<br> Some studies suggest that yoga programs may contribute to lower recidivism rates among formerly incarcerated individuals.<br></p>

	<section class="p7"> 
				<h1>Supporting Reintegration into Society:<br></h1>
				<p>Tools for coping with stress and challenges:<br> Yoga provides individuals with valuable tools and techniques for managing stress, anxiety, and the challenges of re-entry into society.<br></p>

				<p>Enhanced resilience and self-efficacy:<br> Yoga empowers individuals to build resilience, develop a sense of agency, and believe in their ability to succeed in their lives outside of prison.<br></p>

				<p>Breaking the cycle of negative behaviors:<br> By addressing trauma, improving self-regulation, and fostering positive social connections, yoga helps individuals break free from the cycles that may have led to their incarceration.<br></p>
